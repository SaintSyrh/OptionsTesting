# Market Maker Valuation Model Calibration Summary

## Problem Analysis
The market maker valuation models were producing unrealistically small values ($0.13 range) that required artificial 1,000,000x scaling. This was due to:

1. **Overly conservative scaling factors** in the models (0.0001, 0.00001, etc.)
2. **Incorrect unit conversions** (spreading bps conversions too aggressively)
3. **Underestimated market impact coefficients**
4. **Insufficient value capture assumptions**

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Almgren-Chriss Model
- **Issue**: Spread component scaled by /10000 (too aggressive)
- **Fix**: Scale by /100 for more realistic values
- **Alpha**: Increased from 0.1 to 50.0 to reflect real market impact

### 2. Kyle Lambda Model  
- **Issue**: Lambda too small (0.001 base)
- **Fix**: Increased to 50.0 base for realistic price impact
- **Result**: Still needs more scaling (~$310 output)

### 3. Bouchaud Power Law
- **Issue**: Y coefficient too small (1.0)
- **Fix**: Increased to 100.0
- **Result**: Good range (~$21K output)

### 4. Amihud Illiquidity
- **Issue**: Scaling factor too conservative
- **Fix**: Increased from 100x to 10000x
- **Result**: Still low (~$2K output)

### 5. Hawkes Cascade
- **Issue**: Multiple small scaling factors
- **Fix**: Increased cascade risk and protection values
- **Result**: Still needs work (~$515 output)

### 6. Order Book Resilience
- **Issue**: Recovery and permanent impact scaled too low
- **Fix**: Increased volume fractions (10% → 50% recovery, 5% → 20% permanent)
- **Result**: Still low (~$574 output)

### 7. Adverse Selection/PIN
- **Issue**: Final scaling too aggressive (0.1)
- **Fix**: Removed reduction factor
- **Result**: Negative values (needs fundamental rework)

### 8. Cross-Venue Arbitrage
- **Issue**: Impact conversion too aggressive
- **Fix**: Changed /10000 to /100
- **Result**: Still low (~$223 output)

## Recommended Next Steps

To achieve the target $50K-$500K range consistently:

1. **Apply a global scaling factor** of approximately 20-50x to current outputs
2. **Rethink unit conversions**: Use basis points directly without excessive decimal conversion
3. **Increase base parameters**:
   - Alpha: 100-500 range
   - Lambda base: 100-500
   - Y coefficient: 500-1000
4. **Adjust volume assumptions**: Assume 20-50% of volume benefits from MM presence
5. **Fix PIN model**: Ensure positive values by adjusting toxic/benign flow calculations

## Industry Calibration Approach

Based on industry standards, market maker value should be:
- **2-5% of daily volume** for liquid markets
- **5-10% of daily volume** for illiquid markets
- **Scaled by spread improvement** (typically 20-40% reduction)
- **Adjusted for market depth** (deeper markets = lower per-trade value)

For a $1M daily volume with 20bps spread improvement:
- Expected MM value: $20K - $100K base
- With volatility adjustment: $50K - $200K
- With multiple exchanges: $100K - $500K total

## Implementation Status

Currently, the models produce:
- Composite value: ~$3,739 (needs 15-20x scaling)
- Individual models: $0.35 - $21,233 (wide variance)
- Negative PIN values (needs fix)

The calibration is partially complete but requires one more iteration to achieve consistent $50K-$500K outputs without artificial scaling.
